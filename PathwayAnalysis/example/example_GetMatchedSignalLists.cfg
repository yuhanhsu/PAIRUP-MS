[Input Files]

# input file containing pairs of known metabolites shared between two datasets
#	tab-delimited file with 2 column headers (e.g. Data2_Metabolite, Data1_Metabolite) 
sharedFile: example_2-1_shared_knowns.txt

# input file containing pairs of matched signals
#	tab-delimited file with 2 column headers (e.g. Data2_Signal, Data1_Signal)
#	can be derived from output of "ImputationMatching" pipeline
#	signals in 1st column should be unique
#	set to 'NA' if do not want to use matched signals
matchedFile: example_2-1_matched_signals.txt

# input file(s) containing signal lists of first dataset to be mapped to the second dataset
#	each row is a list of signals seperated by ';'
#	generated by IdTraitSignals_Pearson.py or IdNullTraitSignals_Pearson.py, (or _Ranksum.py equivalent)
#	seperate file names with ','
listFiles: example_2_Trait_Pearson_p0.2_signals.txt,example_2_NullTrait_Pearson_signals_55.txt

[Output Files]

# output file(s) containining convereted signal lists (in second dataset)
#	each row is a list of signals seperated by ';'
#	seperate file names with ',' (should match number of files in "listFiles")
outListFiles: example_2-1_Trait_Pearson_p0.2_signals.txt,example_2-1_NullTrait_Pearson_signals_55.txt

# output file containing list of all mapped signals (in second dataset) 
#	each row is a signal
#	set to 'NA' if do not want to output
